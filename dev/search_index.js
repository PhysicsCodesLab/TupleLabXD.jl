Chosen implementations are typically faster than the corresponding functions in base for those small tuple lengths, but can be slower for larger tuples. Inference breaks down for most functions in case of inhomogeneous tuples.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Note that none of the following functions are exported, since their name often collides with the equivalent functions (with different implementations) in Base. Some functions here provided just have an equivalent in Base that doesn't work for tuples at all, like sort or cumsum and cumprod. Some functions also provide reasonable defaults assuming that they are used for tuples of Ints, i.e. TupleLabXD.sum(()) = 0 or TupleLabXD.prod(()) = 1 (whereas the corresponding Base functions would error). This originates from the assumption that these methods are used to operate on tuples of e.g. sizes, indices or strides of multidimensional arrays.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Types","page":"Home","title":"Types","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"TupleLabXD.StaticLength","category":"page"},{"location":"#TupleLabXD.StaticLength","page":"Home","title":"TupleLabXD.StaticLength","text":"struct StaticLength{N} end\n\nLike Val{N}, StaticLength can be used to construct a tuple of inferrable length using ntuple(f, StaticLength(N)).
